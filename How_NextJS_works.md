- #### NextJS is a framework, which organize and optimize the application both in development and deployment process.
- #### There are 2 types of environment where our code works:
   ##### 1. Development: Running and building the application in the local system.
   ##### 2. Production(or deployment): The process where the application is available for end-users.
   
- #### In NextJS, the production optimization processs includes `Compilation`, `Bundling`, `Minifying` and `Code Splitting`
  ##### 1. `Compilation`: The operation of converting code in one language(that developers write) and outputting it in another version of that languange(browser compatible lannguage).

 *From the below image, it clearly demonstartes what Compilation is*
